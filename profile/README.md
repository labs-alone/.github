## Our Current Projects  

### [Vae - An Advanced Conversational LLM Framework](https://github.com/labs-alone/vae)  
Vae is a modular, open-source conversational AI framework designed for the decentralized era. It bridges the power of advanced AI with the flexibility of systems.  

Key features:  
- Plugin-based architecture with hot-swappable components  
- Multi-provider LLM support, including OpenAI and custom integrations  
- Semantic storage powered by PostgreSQL and pgvector  
- Extensible manager system for customizable conversational behaviors  

Explore Vae in its [repository](https://github.com/labs-alone/vae).

### [Toolkit - LLM Function Calling Framework](https://github.com/labs-alone/alone-main)
Toolkit is a Go AND Rust package that simplifies building and managing LLM function calling tools. It provides a clean interface for implementing AI-compatible functions and organizing them into toolkits.

Key features:
- Abstract Tool interface for implementing LLM-compatible functions
- Toolkit management for grouping related tools
- Functional options pattern for configuration
- JSON schema support for function parameters and returns
